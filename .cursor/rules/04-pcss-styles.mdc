### PCSS Styles

- **Location**: Component styles live next to components under `app/components/primer/**.pcss`.
- **Build**: PostCSS processes via [postcss.config.js](mdc:postcss.config.js); utilities generated by [script/build-utilities](mdc:script/build-utilities).
- **Mixins**: Shared mixins in `lib/postcss_mixins/**`.

Conventions:
- Prefer Primer CSS variables and utility classes.
- Keep component styles scoped under a root class for the component.
- Avoid global selectors; favor BEM-like structure consistent with existing components.
